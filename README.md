<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>KOBVON is the Verifiable Organizations Network for the city of Kochi. The goal of the Verifiable Organizations Network (VON) project is to explore the design of an open, unified and trusted network of organizational data for use by people and services across the city of Kochi. The network can reduce the effort put forward by people looking to use services requiring data about their organization since it is readily available from trusted sources. It consist of a series of ecosystems. Each ecosystem consists of an OrgBook in the middle and a number of services that access the OrgBook to get claims verified and issue verifiable credentials to OrgBook.</p>

<h2>Dependent Projects<h2>
<p>TBD</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>•	Using VON makes applying for credentials faster and less error prone</p>
<p>•	It makes issuing of credentials simpler and more secure</p>
<p>•	VON facilitates verifying credentials more standard, trustworthy, and transparent manner.</p>

<p>In addition to this Von network has other advantages over the traditional mechanisms 
•	Von makes datas available to users so they won't need to find it and re-enter it and shared when its open, or shared otherwise with consent.
•	The digital services will simplify their users' experience through access to a network of unified data and decreased time to market and costs as they won't have to re-create costly capabilities related to data collection and management</p>

<h2>Status of the project</h2>
<p>Incubation</p> 
<h2>Solution</h2>
<p>We can be do this with the help of tools and libraries like Hyperledger Indy, Aries, Ursa. And thus, we can develop independent digital identifiers rooted on block chain. We use an approach called the verifiable credential model and these are cryptographically protected data which is used to prove who we are. We also use self-sovereign identity and decentralized identifiers which are independent of the central authorities. Self Sovereign identity (SSI) is a promising approach to decentralized handling of personal data that gives users back control of their data where it belongs. SSI further enables a higher level of trust on the internet by providing mechanisms that enable verifiable identification of parties to translation, reducing the need for a high-cost, in-person mechanism to establish trust. This will enable the massive reduction in exposure of data during the identifying process. By clubbing all these blockchain enable us to move away from identity challenges and move towards a more trusted, self-sovereign identity Internet is the main challenge regarding our project.</p>
