<h1>Things Learnt</h1>
<p>We are learning how to build a verifiable organization network for entities at a particular area. This will help us establish a better way to find ,issue, store and share trustworthy data about organization .This network can also reduce the amount of effort by people as the necessary datas will be readily available from trusted sources. Further the datas is available to users so that they do not have to find and re-enter it. This can be done with the help of tools and libraries like Hyperledger Indy, Aries, Ursa. And thus, we can develop independent digital identifiers rooted on block chain. Here we use an approach called the verifiable credential model and these are cryptographically protected data which is used to prove who we are. We also use self-sovereign identity and decentralized identifiers which are independent of the central authorities. This will enable the massive reduction in exposure of data during the identifying process. By clubbing all these blockchain enable us to move away from identity challenges and move towards a more trusted, self-sovereign identity Internet is the main challenge regarding our project.<p>
